        "## Getting started with AI Research/Projects\n",
        "\n",
        "There is a lot going on in the field of Deep learning(DL) and AI Research and Applications. Getting started in a particular DL area can be overwhelming. Various sub-fields make up the larger area of ML and AI. Some of these are:\n",
        "1. Natural Language Processing(NLP): Using AI/ML Algorithms to process and understand human text/speech. Under the Machine Learning tasks the text aspect finds more applications because speech related tasks utilize disciplines outside ML. Some of the common tasks for NLP are Sentiment Analysis, Natural Language generation, Text Summarization etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Computer Vision (CV): CV uses ML/AI models to understand and interpret digital images and videos. The result of these models can help detect objects and take some action based on that.To train a computer to understand visual data, it can be fed many labeled images and then subject to algorithms that help it identify patterns in the images.Some of the known use cases for CV are self driving cars,defect detection,medical imaging,image retrieval,image segmentation etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Machine Learning(ML): Although ML encompasses all other sub-fields mentioned in this list but from the perspective of research the core algorithms can be further studied and improved. For example optimizing learning algorithms for better performance. Ideas from Operations research can be combined to improve the existing models and algorithms. Some examples include simulations, decision analysis, stochatic programming etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Internet of Things(IoT): IoT is a network of multiple devices connected together exchanging data. This data can be analyzed for actionable results/decisions. Examples include self driving cars, Industrial IoT, healthcare IoT, Navigating apps etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Recommender Systems (RS): A RS can be based on Content-based Recommendation or even Collaborative Filtering.\n",
        "Content-Based Recommendation is done by analyzing the content of all the items. For example, you can be recommended books you might like based on Natural Language Processing done on the books. On the other hand, Collaborative Filtering is done by analyzing your past reading behavior and then recommending books based on that. Both streams have their advantages and drawbacks and a lot of research is going on to improve recommendations. Hybrid recommender systems are one such area of research. Cold start problem in RS is another area of active research. Applying RS in other domains like finance education etc. is another relevant area of research.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Neural Networks(NN): The basic NN structure is considered to be a Universal Approximator that has the ability to learn any complex pattern. There are associated downsides to this ability namely overfitting, slow convergence etc. Experimenting with different network configurations for better overall results is another significan research area.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Reinforcement Learning: RL mimics the trial-and-error learning process that humans use to achieve their goals. Software actions that work towards your goal are reinforced, while actions that detract from the goal are ignored. RL algorithms excel in complex environments that have more rules and dependencies and require less human interaction. Some of the use cases are improving recommender systems. For example, an application may display ads to a user based on some demographic information. With each ad interaction, the application learns which ads to display to the user to optimize product sales.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Generative AI (GAI): GAI models have the ability to create novel, diverse, and useful content. GAI are revolutionizing numerous domains like music generation, healthcare,content creation, video/picture generation, fraud detection etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. AI and Ethics: There is a growing concern on the ethical implications of AI and its usage. For example some of the known Language models have racial and gender bias in them. Using these as inputs to other models may lead to bias and discriminatory outcomes. One of the significant challenges in AI ethics is ensuring that AI systems are free from bias. One example of such problem could be to come up with debiasing algorithms/techniques.\n",
