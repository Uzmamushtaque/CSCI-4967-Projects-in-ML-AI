        "\n",
        "A time series is a set of data points ordered in time.\n",
        "The data is equally spaced in time, meaning that it was recorded at every hour, minute,\n",
        "month, or quarter. Typical examples of time series include the closing value of a\n",
        "stock, a household’s electricity consumption, or the temperature outside.\n",
        "\n",
        "Components of a time series:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Trend: The slow moving changes in a time series is called trend. it is responsible for making the series gradually increase or decrease over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Seasonality: The seasonality component represents the seasonal pattern in the series. The cycles\n",
        "occur repeatedly over a fixed period of time.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Residuals: This corresponds to random errors, also termed white noise.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Important concepts\n",
        "\n",
        "**Stationarity:** A stationary time series is one whose statistical properties do not change over time. In\n",
        "other words, it has a constant mean, variance, and autocorrelation, and these properties\n",
        "are independent of time.\n",
        "Many forecasting models assume stationarity.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Transformation:** A transformation is a mathematical operation applied to a time series in order to\n",
        "make it stationary.\n",
        "Differencing is a transformation that calculates the change from one timestep to\n",
        "another. This transformation is useful for stabilizing the mean.\n",
        "Applying a log function to the series can stabilize its variance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Test for stationarity:** The augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test helps us determine if a time series is stationary\n",
        "by testing for the presence of a unit root. If a unit root is present, the time series\n",
        "is not stationary.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Autocorrelation function:**  The autocorrelation function (ACF) measures the linear relationship between lagged\n",
        "values of a time series.\n",
        "In other words, it measures the correlation of the time series with itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Partial Autocorrelation Function:** Partial autocorrelation measures the correlation between lagged values in a time\n",
        "series when we remove the influence of correlated lagged values in between. We can\n",
        "plot the partial autocorrelation function to determine the order of a stationary AR(p)\n",
        "process. The coefficients will be non-significant after lag p.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Akaike Information Criteria (AIC):** The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) lets you test how well your model fits the data set without over-fitting it.\n",
        "\n",
        "The AIC score rewards models that achieve a high goodness-of-fit score and penalizes them if they become overly complex.\n",
        "\n",
        "By itself, the AIC score is not of much use unless it is compared with the AIC score of a competing model.\n",
        "\n",
        "The model with the lower AIC score is expected to strike a superior balance between its ability to fit the data set and its ability to avoid over-fitting the data set."
